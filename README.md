# ProyectoEspejo

 Hello. This is our proyect for the our university project IOT that consists in the prototype of the inteligent mirrow made by us and 
 the android applicacion which you can see here. 

 As the code is still in development all the code you can see en the branch "Chino".

 In our application we use such technologies as MQTT and bluetooth.
 Also we implements some APIs to make better the user experience. We have 3 different ways to enter in your account: 
 1. Registrate your mail and enter with you email
 2. Enter with Google
 3. Enter with Facebook. (As our application is in development you could not enter with this method because you will need the permition for your account).

 On the page home of the applicacion you will see information about your account, the weather for today and spotify, that will request your account to
 be connected to choose and change the songs from your playlist directly from our app.

 In the first tab you will see a color roulete that is connected to the leds by MQTT protocol. There you will be able to change the color, intensity
 and save this settings as a mode into your list "modos guardados". 

 The second tab is about the spotify where you could change the song, pause it or go to the spotify application to change the playlist that is running.

 Next tab is a home tab where the user can consult the main information like status of light(on/off), the temperature that is caught from the sensor and sent by MQTT and the API for today.

 The fourth one is made to upload the fotos from your device to save in our data base.

 In the last tab you can change your application preferences, consult the information of your account, change it and learn a bit about our company.
